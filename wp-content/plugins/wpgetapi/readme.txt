This is perfect for lead generation forms, contact forms or really any other type form that requires you to send form data to an API.


= Can I use an XML based API? =

Yes, we support XML with our [PRO Plugin](https://wpgetapi.com/downloads/pro-plugin/?utm_campaign=Pro&utm_medium=wporg&utm_source=faq)


= How do I connect WordPress to an API? =

By using this plugin of course! Check out the video at the top of this page or visit our [Quick Start Guide](https://wpgetapi.com/docs/quick-start-guide/?utm_campaign=Quick-Start&utm_medium=wporg&utm_source=faq) to get started with connecting your WordPress website with an API.

We support caching with our [PRO Plugin](https://wpgetapi.com/downloads/pro-plugin/?utm_campaign=Pro&utm_medium=wporg&utm_source=faq). It also recognises dynamic queries and will cache these individually.

A dynamic query might be something like these:

The PRO plugin recognises that whilst they are the same endpoint, they are different queries that need to be cached separately.
